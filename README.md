# `pnml`

`pnml` is an Erlang module for processing Petri Net Markup Language
(PNML) files.

## PNML

PNML is an XML based mark up language that acts as an interchange
format for Petri net definitions.

To learn more about PNML see [http://www.pnml.org/](http://www.pnml.org/)

Also, these following two papers provide good introduction to the
language:

- L.M. Hillah and E. Kindler and F. Kordon and L. Petrucci and
  N. TrÃ¨ves,
  A primer on the Petri Net Markup Language and ISO/IEC 15909-2

## Petri Net

To quote from the description on Wikipedia:

> _"A Petri net, also known as a place/transition (PT) net, is one of
